# Capstone Project Report: A Fully-Fledged website for Speech Therapists.
1. ## Project Overview
This project is a web-based platform designed exclusively for speech therapists to efficiently find therapy goals and activities for children with autism and similar disorders.
It streamlines therapy planning by generating structured activity suggestions based on a child's age and country.
The system eliminates the need for therapists to manually search for therapy activities across different sources.
Future enhancements include AI-powered recommendations to provide personalized therapy plans.
For instance, a 3-year-old child with a speech-language disorder secondary to autism, goals should focus on improving communication, social interaction, and functional language skills. Activities should be engaging, structured, and tailored to the childâ€™s interests and sensory preferences. (it differs for different age groups)




2. ## Problem Statement
-Therapists struggle to find appropriate therapy activities for children with autism and related disorders and often find themselves searching on YouTube for similar activities for the child .
-There is no centralized platform for therapy goals, leading to time-consuming searches across multiple sources.
-Therapy approaches vary by region or the country they come from (Indians and other Asian countries, Middle Eastern parts, Americans, Africans etc.), but current solutions do not cater to region-specific therapy needs.
-Difficulties arise when therapists work with clients from different cultural backgrounds, requiring different therapy techniques.


3. ## What Makes This Website Different?
-Exclusive for Therapists: Unlike general therapy platforms, this system is tailored specifically for professional therapists.
-Region-Specific Therapy Recommendations: Unlike existing platforms, this system considers cultural and regional differences when suggesting therapy activities.
-Centralized Therapy Resource: Instead of searching on YouTube or other platforms, therapists get all therapy goals & activities in ONE place.
-Future AI Enhancements: Unlike traditional therapy tools, this platform will integrate AI to adapt recommendations based on therapist feedback and child progress.
